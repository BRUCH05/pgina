title: Do shared services and devices authenticate users via pGina?

No.

pGina is intended as a replacement for the *interactive* login process.
Access to network shared items like printers, drives/folders,
etc on another machine - do not use the portion of the OS that
pGina provides replacements for. That said, the 3.x architecture
does allow for this kind of thing in the future, by moving much (arguably all)
actual processing into a dedicated service, *any* part of the OS
which can be augmented, could potentially validate credentials using the pGina
framework. For things like shared services, this would require an LSA module.
This is outside the scope of the pGina project,
but we've tried to make it flexible enough that experimentation
in this area could be done!
