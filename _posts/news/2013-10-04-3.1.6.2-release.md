After a long way of testing and fixing I got pGina how I want it to be.

[Download](download.html) a copy of the release.

What's different in this 3.1.6.2 fork compared with pGina 3.1.6.0:

* An improved login mask
* Event based logoff in the Local Machine plugin
* A new plugin called pgSMB
* Various bug fixes and other improvements.
